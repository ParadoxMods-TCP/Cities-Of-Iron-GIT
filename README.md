## Building from source
If you like this mod, or you have your thoughts about the mod, why not go to [Discussions]()? If no, you are also suggested to create your own mod/compile the mod yourself: Please note that the complete guide for MacOS and SerenityOS is yet to be completed. For UOS users, either of the guides can be used.

## Compatibility notice:
Since Hearts of Iron 4 uses the Clausewitz engine while Cities: Skylines 2 and 1 uses a specialized Unity engine, we try to emulate the Clausewitz engine using Unity and make it a Unity plugin favorable for users to edit its [configuration file](). If the game with this mod activated are not able to compile successfully, it has a high chance to be the emulated Clausewitz engine to mistakenly read other mod files. You are suggested to change the configuration file in this case.
Beneath are some known incompatible issues. The reason, error name, and the way to fix it are left for your reference, while some of the beneath are not able to run with the mods (future update)
